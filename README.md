# Finite-State-Machine
Created a finite state machine(FSM) using a clock divider, a hex decoder and a multi mode counter. The multi-mode counter circuit uses two 7 segment decoder circuits to display the value of the counter on the FPGA board. Complete description is written in the attached lab report. 


This was done with the help of a friend: Mustafain Ali Khan
